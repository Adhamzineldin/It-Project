            <h2>Carpenter Ants</h2>
            <img src="../../resources/img/Invertebrates/carpenter-ants.jpg" alt="Carpenter Ants">
        <p>Carpenter ants are known for their ability to excavate wood to create nests. Unlike termites, which eat wood, carpenter ants hollow out wooden structures to build their nests. They are typically black, red, or a combination of both colors and vary in size depending on their caste.</p>
        <p>Carpenter ants are commonly found in forests, urban areas, and buildings. While they are not usually aggressive towards humans, large colonies can cause structural damage to wooden structures if left unchecked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ant" id="Fire">
            <h2>Fire Ants</h2>
            <img src="../../resources/img/Invertebrates/fire-ants.jpeg" alt="Fire Ants">
        <p>Fire ants are aggressive ants known for their painful stings. They are native to South America but have spread to many parts of the world, including the southern United States and Australia. Fire ant colonies build large mounds in open areas, such as lawns, parks, and agricultural fields.</p>
        <p>Fire ants are omnivorous and feed on a variety of foods, including insects, seeds, and small vertebrates. Their stings can cause allergic reactions in some individuals and can be dangerous, especially to pets and small children.</p>

            <h2>Army Ants</h2>
            <img src="../../resources/img/Invertebrates/Army-Ants.jpg" alt="Army Ants">
        <p>Army ants are nomadic ants known for their aggressive foraging behavior. They live in temporary nests made of their own bodies, known as bivouacs, which they construct each night. During the day, army ants form long trails as they search for food, primarily consisting of insects and other arthropods.</p>
        <p>Army ants are found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They play important roles in their ecosystems by controlling insect populations and serving as prey for various predators.</p>
