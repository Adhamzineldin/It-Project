            <h2>Orb-Weaving Spiders</h2>
            <img src="../../resources/img/Invertebrates/orb.jpg" alt="Orb-Weaving spider">
        <p>Orb-weaving spiders are known for their intricate, wheel-shaped webs. These spiders construct large, circular webs made of sticky silk to catch flying insects like flies, mosquitoes, and moths. They are often found in gardens, forests, and grasslands. Some common examples of orb-weaving spiders include the garden orb-weaver spider (Araneus diadematus) and the golden orb-weaver spider (Nephila spp.).</p>
        <p>Orb-weaving spiders are typically harmless to humans and play an essential role in controlling insect populations.</p>

            <h2>Jumping Spiders</h2>
            <img src="../../resources/img/Invertebrates/jumping.jpg" alt="Jumping spider">
        <p>Jumping spiders are known for their excellent vision and agile movements. Unlike many other spiders, they do not rely on webs to catch prey. Instead, jumping spiders actively hunt for insects, often using their exceptional eyesight to spot and stalk their prey. They are capable of jumping several times their body length, using their powerful back legs.</p>
        <p>Jumping spiders are found in a wide range of habitats worldwide, including forests, grasslands, and urban areas. They are curious creatures and are known for their inquisitive behavior, often exploring their surroundings and even interacting with humans.</p>

            <h2>Wolf Spiders</h2>
            <img src="../../resources/img/Invertebrates/wolf.jpg" alt="Wolf spider">
	<p>Wolf spiders are robust and agile hunters that do not rely on webs to catch prey. They are named for their hunting behavior, which resembles that of wolves. These spiders actively hunt on the ground, chasing down insects, small arthropods, and even small vertebrates like lizards and frogs.</p>
        <p>Wolf spiders are commonly found in grasslands, forests, and gardens. They are solitary creatures and are often encountered wandering on the ground, especially during the night. Wolf spiders are venomous but rarely bite humans unless provoked, and their bites are usually not dangerous.</p>
