            <p>Mollusk, any soft-bodied invertebrate of the phylum Mollusca, usually wholly or partly enclosed in a calcium carbonate
            shell secreted by a soft mantle covering the body. Along with the insects and vertebrates, it is one of the most diverse
            groups in the animal kingdom, with nearly 100,000 (possibly as many as 150,000) described species. Each group includes
            an ecologically and structurally immense variety of forms.</p>

            <h2>Gastropods</h2>
            <br>
            This class comprises snails and slugs from saltwater, freshwater, and from the land. There are many thousands of species
            of sea snails and slugs, as well as freshwater snails, freshwater limpets, land snails and slugs.
            The class Gastropoda is a diverse and highly successful class of mollusks within the phylum Mollusca. It contains a vast
            total of named species, second only to the insects in overall number. The fossil history of this class goes back to the
            Late Cambrian. As of 2017, 721 families of gastropods are known, of which 245 are extinct and appear only in the fossil
            record, while 476 are currently extant with or without a fossil record.

            <h2>Cephalopoda</h2>
            <br>
        Cephalopod, any member of the class Cephalopoda of the phylum Mollusca, a small group of highly advanced and organized,
        exclusively marine animals. The octopus, squid, cuttlefish, and chambered nautilus are familiar representatives. The
        extinct forms outnumber the living, the class having attained great diversity in late Paleozoic and Mesozoic times. The
        extinct cephalopods are the ammonites, belemnites, and nautiloids, except for five living species of Nautilus.

            <h2>Scaphopoda</h2><br>
            The tusk shell is open at both ends, unlike most mollusks.
            The wider end (anterior) extends out, while the narrower end (posterior) is usually at or below the substrate.
            The shell surrounds a large mantle cavity and forms a tube.
            Scaphopods lack ctenidia (gills), and gas exchange occurs through the mantle surface.
