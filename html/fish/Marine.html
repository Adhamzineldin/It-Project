            <p>Marine mammals are found in marine ecosystems around the globe. They are a diverse group of mammals with unique physical
            adaptations that allow them to thrive in the marine environment with extreme temperatures, depths, pressure, and
            darkness.</p>

            <p><h2>Dolphins</h2>
            <br>
                Dolphins are small-toothed cetaceans easily recognizable by their curved mouths, which give them a permanent “smile.”
                There are 36 dolphin species, found in every ocean. Most dolphins are marine and live in the ocean or brackish waters
                along coastlines. There are a few species, however, like the South Asian river dolphin and the Amazon river dolphin, or
                boto, that live in freshwater streams and rivers.

            <p><h2>Sharks</h2>
                <br>
                Sharks star in blockbuster movies as blood-seeking villains, but in reality they're far more fascinating and complicated
                than they're often depicted in pop culture.
                Based on fossilized teeth and scales, scientists believe that sharks have been around for more than 400 million
                years—long before the dinosaurs. The ocean's top predators have evolved into roughly 500 species that come in all
                different sizes and colors and have varying diets and behavior.

        <p><h2>Whales</h2>
            <br>
            Whales are the largest animals on Earth and they live in every ocean. The massive mammals range from the 600-pound dwarf
            sperm whale to the colossal blue whale, which can weigh more than 200 tons and stretch up to 100 feet long—almost as
            long as a professional basketball court.
            Whales are warm-blooded creatures that nurse their young
