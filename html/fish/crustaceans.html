            <p>Crustaceans are some of the most important marine animals. Humans rely heavily on crustaceans for food; and crustaceans
            are also an important prey source for marine life in the ocean food chain for a variety of animals, including whales,
            fish, and pinnipeds.
            More diverse than any group of arthropods, crustaceans are second or third in abundance of all categories of animal life
            after insects and vertebrates. They live in inland and ocean waters from the Arctic to the Antarctic as well as from
            elevations in the Himalayas up to 16,000 feet to well below sea level.</p>

            <p><h2>Hermit-Crab</h2><br>
                Hermit crabs are omnivorous scavengers, eating microscopic mussels and clams, bits of dead animals, and macroalgae.
                These crustaceans have been misnamed for two reasons: First, they're not true crabs, like blue crabs, in that they don't
                have a uniformly hard exoskeleton and can't grow their own shells. Instead, hermit crabs have a hard exoskeleton on the
                front part of their bodies but a soft tail on the other half, which they protect using the discarded shells of other
                animals, like whelks. They're more closely related to certain kinds of lobsters than to true crabs.

            <p><h2>Crayfish</h2><br>
                Crayfish, also known as crawfish or crawdads, are freshwater crustaceans from the Astacidae family. They inhabit
                streams, rivers, lakes, and swamps. Crayfish have distinctively large pincers and play important ecological roles as
                both prey and predators. Some species are also popular in the aquarium trade, and certain crayfish are commercially
                fished for human consumption

            <p><h2>Barnacles</h2><br>
                Barnacles are sessile crustaceans that attach themselves to hard surfaces such as rocks, ship hulls, and even the shells
                of other animals. They have a unique feeding mechanism where they extend feathery appendages (cirri) to filter plankton
                and other organic particles from the water. Despite their seemingly immobile lifestyle, barnacles are highly successful
                and diverse in marine ecosystems
