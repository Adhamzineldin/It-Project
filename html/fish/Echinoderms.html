            <p>Echinoderm, any of a variety of invertebrate marine animals belonging to the phylum Echinodermata, characterized by a
            hard, spiny covering or skin. Beginning with the dawn of the Cambrian Period (542 million to 488 million years ago),
            echinoderms have a rich fossil history and are well represented by many bizarre groups, most of which are now extinct.</p>

            <h2>Asteroidea</h2>
            <br>
        Starfish are marine invertebrates. They typically have a central disc and usually five arms, though some species have a
        larger number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping
        plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown.
        Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are
        opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on benthic invertebrates.

            <br>
            Brittle stars, serpent stars, or ophiuroids  referring to the serpent-like arms of the brittle star are echinoderms in the class
            Ophiuroidea, closely related to starfish. They crawl across the sea floor using their flexible arms for locomotion. The
            ophiuroids generally have five long, slender, whip-like arms which may reach up to 60 cm (24 in) in length on the
            largest specimens.

            <br>
            Crinoids are marine invertebrates that make up the class Crinoidea. Crinoids that are attached to the sea bottom by a
            stalk in their juvenile form are commonly called sea lilies, while the unstalked forms, called feather stars or
            comatulids,They live in both shallow water and in depths as great as 9,000 meters (30,000 ft).
