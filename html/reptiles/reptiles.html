      <h1>Welcome to the world of Reptiles</h1>
      <p>
        Reptiles around the world play important ecosystem roles–both as prey to large mammals and birds <br> and as
        predators for small mammals, birds and insects. By keeping small mammal populations in check, <br> they limit
        the spread of diseases that can harm people.

        <h1>Squamates</h1>
        <p>
          Squamates (Squamata) are the most diverse of all the reptile groups, with approximately 7400 living species.
          <br>
          Squamates include lizards, snakes, and worm lizards. <br>
          There are two characteristics that unite the squamates. The first is that they shed their skin periodically.
          <br>
          Some squamates, such as snakes, shed their skin in one piece. Other squamates, such as many lizards, shed
          their skin in patches. <br>
          In contrast, non-squamate reptiles regenerate their scales by other means—for example, crocodiles shed a
          single scale at a time <br>
          while turtles do not shed the scales that cover their carapace and instead add new layers from beneath. <br>
          The second characteristic shared by squamates is their uniquely jointed skulls and jaws, which are both strong
          and flexible. <br>
          The extraordinary jaw mobility of squamates enables them to open their mouths very wide and in doing so,
          consume large prey. <br>
          Additionally, the strength of their skull and jaws provides squamates with a powerful bite grip.

        <h1>Turtles</h1>
        <p>
          Spends most of its life in the water. Turtles tend to have webbed feet for swimming. 
          Sea turtles (Cheloniidae family) are especially adapted for an acquatic life, 
          with long feet that form flippers and a streamlined body shape. They rarely leave the ocean,
          except when the females come ashore to lay their eggs, although some, such as the green sea turtle, 
          do come out on reefs and beaches to bask. Other turtles live in fresh water, like ponds and lakes. 
          They swim, but they also climb out onto banks, logs, or rocks to bask in the sun. In cold weather, 
          they may burrow into the mud, where they go into torpor until spring brings warm weather again.
