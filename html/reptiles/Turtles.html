    <h3>Turtles are reptiles with hard shells that protect them from predators.
      They are among the oldest and most primitive groups of reptiles, having evolved millions of years ago.
      Turtles live all over the world in almost every type of climate.

    <p>
      Turtles are reptiles known for their distinctive shells.
      They belong to the order Testudines and have been around for over 200 million years.
      Turtles are found in various habitats, including oceans, freshwater lakes, and terrestrial environments.
      They have adapted to a wide range of diets,
      with some being herbivores, others omnivores, and a few carnivores. Turtles are characterized by their shell,
      which is composed of an upper carapace and a lower plastron, providing them protection from predators.
      They lay eggs on land, and many species are known for their migrations across vast distances.
      Turtles play important ecological roles in their ecosystems and are often considered keystone species.
      However, many turtle species are threatened due to habitat loss, pollution, and illegal trade.
      Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of these ancient reptiles.

      Tortoises are terrestrial reptiles belonging to the family Testudinidae. They are characterized by their hard,
      bony shells and stubby, elephant-like legs. Tortoises are primarily herbivorous,
      feeding on vegetation such as grasses, leaves, fruits, and flowers. They are known for their longevity, with some
      species living well over 100 years.
      Tortoises are found in various habitats around the world, including deserts, grasslands, and forests.
      They are ectothermic, relying on their environment to regulate body temperature,
      and they often retreat into burrows or shady areas to avoid extreme heat. Tortoises play important roles in their
      ecosystems as seed dispersers and grazers,
      contributing to the maintenance of plant diversity. They are also popular as pets due to their docile nature and
      unique appearance,
      though responsible ownership requires adequate space and proper care to meet their specialized needs.
